## Syllabus

This short course teaches you to analyze and visualize large, complex
biological data sets use the R statistical programming language,
RStudio, and new tools available in the “tidyverse”. We use common
biological experiments to illustrate analysis strategies including
studies of mRNA expression, histone post-translational modification in
the context of chromatin, and cell-type characterization using single
cell approaches.
