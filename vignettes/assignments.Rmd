# Grades

Your grade is based on a combination of:

- Pre-requisite completion (5%)
- Attendance and Participation (15%)
- Assignments (80%)

# Assignments

There are two types of assignments in the course:

- Nightly quizzes, worth 25 points.
- Weekend analyses, worth 50 points.

Assignments must be turned in as Rmarkdown text files via Canvas. **They must render completely when the Knit button is clicked**. This menas you will need to load all libraries within the document. This is a good chunk to put in your Rmarkdown code:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(eda)
```

# Grading Rubric

Each assignment problem will be evaluated using the following rubric:

- Text annotations are provided laying out the problem, the strategy, and the conclusions.
- Code is succinct and commented.
- Graph types and layouts are chosen carefully to illustrate a single point.
