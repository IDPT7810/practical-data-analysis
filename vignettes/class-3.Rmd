# Concepts

- Too many variables (identifying important ones, and summarizing others. using colors and facets in plots)
- Reducing dimensionality (PCA and t-SNE)
- Assessing significance (light statistics overview, null distributions, hypothesis testing).
- Dealing with untidy R results (broom::tidy())
- Too much data (in-memory vs. database approaches, subsetting and sampling, simplify with a reprex).
