# Concepts

- Current me thanks former me
- Writing (Rmarkdown, useful RStudio tricks and shortcuts)
- Version control (Github, beyond the scope of this class but super useful)
- Sharing (rpubs.com, RStudio Connect, sending HTML)
- Approaches for data exploration (Shiny *is not reproducible*)
- Date formats (2017-12-25, not Dec 25 2017, "Christmas Day", etc. NYD is 2018-01-01)

# Goals

- Form strong and lasting analysis habits
- Keep cheatsheets handy early on
- Learn new features and concepts as they arise (read the RStudio blog)

# Reading

- Bill Noble Guide to Computational BIology. Organization is paramount.
